# villain_reg_rust
a villain registry

for this application I decieded to go back to my first project that i programmed in java.  
this program is used to demonstate the abilities vectors and structs by allowing  
the user to test some the attributes  
  
## setting up the enviorment

this program was written in rust, this is the first program I ever wrote in rust and there definitly  
are some different syntax trope that i had to get used to, but first things first,   
  
to set up the enviorment i had to download rust from its website (listed below)

after it downloads a .exe file there will be a small console that opens up,  
and it will prompt you to either install rust with the default settings,(which is what I did) or to customize them. 

after download you create your first program by opening your comand prompt and  
navigate to the file you want your program in. when you get there you type  
  
cargo new "name of the program you want"  
  
and then rust will create a new folder system for you with a source file and a couple other system required files.  
  
I used vs code for my ide, and I just had to download the rust extention to use this program.  
  
to test your program you open up your terminal and after saving your file you type  

cargo run  
  
and it will build compile and run your program  
  
## how i built my program  

this program was built to demonstrate how to use

* user input
* variables
* loops
* functions
* stucts
* casting
* vectors

this program used a main function along with a function to  
add an item to the vector  
remove an item from the vector  
display all the items in the vector  
  
## my program in action  

when you first start the program you will be given four options

![instructions example](https://github.com/bshort95/villain_reg_rust/blob/main/vilcapture1.JPG?raw=true) 

if you choose a number outside range or you write a random letter
you will be prompted to make another choice  

![bad instructions](https://github.com/bshort95/villain_reg_rust/blob/main/vilCapture2.JPG?raw=true)

if you enter one you will see the current content of the vector  

![registery content](https://github.com/bshort95/villain_reg_rust/blob/main/vilcapture3.JPG?raw=true)

if you enter two you will be prompted for some details about the vilain you are entering   

![adding example](https://github.com/bshort95/villain_reg_rust/blob/main/vilCapture4.JPG?raw=true)

when you enter three you will be prompted to type the name of the vilain you want to remove  

![remove example](https://github.com/bshort95/villain_reg_rust/blob/main/vilCapture5.JPG?raw=true)

after you are done working with the program you can enter four to exit
